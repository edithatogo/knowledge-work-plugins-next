# Real Estate Next Plugin

An advanced, contractor-focused evolution of the Real Estate plugin. This toolset is specifically designed for independent agents who maintain their own private tech stack outside of corporate oversight. It enables a high-leverage **"Shadow Workflow"** using Vault RE webhooks, private Google Workspace automation, and OpenClaw for personal branding.

## Core Capabilities

- **Shadow Workflow**: Maintain data sovereignty with a private Google Workspace admin account. Use Gemini Pro to synthesize forwarded emails and cross-reference with CRM data.
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time support for **Vault RE** JSON payloads. Automatically prioritize tasks and draft communications based on CRM activity.
- **Shadow Marketing (OpenClaw)**: Build your personal brand on LinkedIn, Instagram, and TikTok with owner-branded content that stays with you, even if you move agencies.
- **Milestone Automation**: Track **Secure Sign** and **DocuSign** progress and automatically update private settlement checklists.
- **Client Intelligence**: Use deep search to vet potential high-value vendors and prepare for listing presentations with a strategic edge.

## Commands

- `/webhook-audit`: Review and audit incoming Vault RE JSON payloads.
- `/shadow-sync`: Synchronize corporate CRM activity with your private Google Sheets/Tasks logs.
- `/private-brief`: Synthesize forwarded email threads and CRM data into a private situation report.
- `/client-intel`: Perform deep research on potential clients using search connectors.
- `/draft-listing`: Create marketing suites optimized for personal branding.
- `/manage-leads`: Rank leads using private conversion probability models.

## Jurisdictional Focus

Defaults to **New Zealand** statutory requirements (REA Act, AML/CFT Act, HCC/WCC LIM standards) with specialized logic for independent contractors.
