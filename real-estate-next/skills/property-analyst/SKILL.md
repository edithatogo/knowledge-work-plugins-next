# Property Analyst (The Evidence Specialist)

A rigorous framework for data-driven property valuation and risk assessment. This skill provides the "Evidence Pack" to justify pricing, calculates financial returns for investors, and scrutinizes statutory documents (LIM, Title) for red flags.

**Important**: This skill provides market appraisals and risk analysis but does not replace a Registered Valuation, formal legal advice from a solicitor, or a building inspection report. All school zone information should be verified with the Ministry of Education.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Generating a market appraisal for a potential listing.
- Preparing an "Appraisal Evidence Pack" comparing features of local sales.
- Calculating Gross/Net Rental Yield and cashflow potential for investors.
- Auditing a Land Information Memorandum (LIM) or Record of Title for red flags.
- Assessing the "Market Cycle" (Boom/Flat/Correction) to adjust pricing strategy.
- Identifying "School Zone Future Proofing" risks (e.g., border zone properties).
- Adjusting appraisals based on "Qualitative Vibe" (e.g., stunning views vs. poor flow).
- Drafting "Buyer Guides" for first-home buyers or local area newcomers.

## Regulatory Context

### Australia & New Zealand (Default)

| Regulation/Standard | Relevance | Key Requirements |
|---------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **REA Code of Conduct** | Appraisal accuracy | Rule 10.6: Appraisals must be supported by comparable data |
| **Local Government Act** | LIM reports | Defining HCC/WCC disclosure requirements for unauthorized works |
| **Land Transfer Act** | Titles | Identifying easements, encumbrances, and land covenants |
| **Income Tax Act (NZ)** | Investment ROI | Understanding "Bright-line" and interest deductibility (high-level) |

### AU/NZ Baseline Specifics
- **LIM Reports**: Understanding the "Hutt City Council" (HCC) baseline for building consents and permits.
- **Comparable Sales**: Requirement for minimum 3 recent, relevant local sales.
- **School Zones**: Analyzing Hutt Valley High, Petone Central, and Waterloo zone boundaries.

## Quick Reference

1. **Set the Cycle**: Identify if the market is Rising, Falling, or Flat.
2. **Select Comparables**: Find 3 recent sales with similar floor area, garaging, and land size.
3. **Justify the Price**: Generate a "Feature Comparison Table" between subject and comparables.
4. **Scrutinize the LIM**: Check for "Unauthorized Works" or "Flood Zone" flags.
5. **Yield Check**: (For investors) Calculate Gross Yield = (Weekly Rent * 52) / Purchase Price.
6. **Vibe Adjustment**: Apply +/- 5% for qualitative factors (e.g., street appeal).
7. **Zone Check**: Flag border properties for potential rezoning risks.

## Operating Modes

### Standard Mode
Full analytical workflow including detailed comparable tables, multi-source due diligence audit (LIM/Title), investment ROI modeling, and school zone risk analysis. Use for formal appraisals and high-stakes buyer/vendor consultations.

### Lite Mode
Rapid calculation of rental yield, quick "LIM Red Flag" check, or a simple 3-sale comparable list. Optimized for high-speed market conversations.

## Detailed Guidance

### 1. The Appraisal "Evidence" Pack

Justify the price to the vendor or buyer:
- **Subject vs. Sales**: Direct comparison of Bed/Bath/Car/Land/Floor Area.
- **Location Premium**: Adjusting for "River side" vs. "Hills side" or specific quiet cul-de-sacs.
- **Time Adjustment**: Indexing a 6-month-old sale to today's "Market Cycle."

### 2. Due Diligence Scrutiny (Red Flags)

Identify risks before they kill the deal:
- **LIM Flags**: Unauthorized bathroom/deck, "Wind Zone" rating, flood plains (HCC maps).
- **Title Flags**: Easements for neighbor access, "Cross-lease" complexities, restrictive covenants (e.g., no caravans).
- **Building Report Flags**: Weathertightness (monolithic cladding), piling issues, asbestos ceiling.

### 3. Investment Yield Calculator

Speak the language of the investor:
- **Gross Yield**: Standard benchmark for market comparison.
- **Net Yield**: Accounting for Rates (HCC is ~0.5% of value), Insurance, and Maintenance.
- **Capital Growth Context**: Mentioning major local infra projects (e.g., Melling Link) impacting future value.

### 4. Market Cycle Adjuster

Tailor strategy to the economic environment:
- **Rising (Boom)**: Aggressive "Tender" or "Auction" strategy; focus copy on "Scarcity."
- **Falling (Correction)**: "Price on Application" or "By Negotiation"; focus copy on "Value" and "Stability."
- **Flat**: "BEO" (Buyer Enquiry Over); focus copy on "Quality" and "Perfect Family Home."

### 5. School Zone Future Proofing

Verify the "Golden Ticket":
- **Core Zone**: Properties well within the boundary (Waterloo/Petone).
- **Border Zone**: Flag as "High Risk" if the Ministry of Education has signaled overcrowding in that zone.
- **Amenity Value**: Quantify the "Zone Premium" (typically 10-15% in Lower Hutt).

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] **Appraisal Evidence Pack**: Comparative table and pricing rationale.
- [ ] **Investment Brief**: ROI/Yield summary for the property.
- [ ] **Due Diligence Log**: Red flags identified in LIM/Title/Building reports.
- [ ] **Buyer Guide Snippet**: Suburb expert highlights for the local area.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Cherry-picking Sales** | Misleads the vendor; violates REA code | Include at least one "low" or "challenging" sale for balance. |
| **Ignoring Unauthorized Works** | Contract crashes during buyer's finance | Flag early and prepare a "Disclosure" for the vendor to sign. |
| **Static Pricing in Falling Market** | Listing goes stale | Recommend a price revision *before* the 21-day mark. |
| **Assuming Yield = Profit** | Ignores HCC rates and interest costs | Explicitly state the difference between Gross and Net yield. |

## When to Escalate

Escalate to Branch Principal or Registered Valuer when:
- The property is unique (e.g., commercial/residential mix) and lacks comparable data.
- The Title has complex "Consent Notices" or "Encumbrances" that require legal interpretation.
- A vendor demands an appraisal value >20% above recent comparable sales.
- The property has significant structural defects identified in a builder's report.

## Privacy Considerations

- **Data Minimization**: Do not retain copies of identifiable LIM reports beyond the campaign period.
- **Confidentiality**: Appraisal values are sensitive to the vendor; do not disclose to third parties without consent.

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Property matches 3 recent sales in the same street | High | Finalize Appraisal Evidence Pack. |
| Border-zone property with conflicting school info | Medium | Flag as "Risk" and require MOE verification. |
| Monolithic cladding with no "Code Compliance Certificate" | Low | Recommend immediate escalation to Registered Valuer/Solicitor. |

## Tool Requirements

- `~~budget data` - For calculating HCC rates and insurance estimates.
- `~~legislation` - For checking REA compliance and Land Transfer Act rules.
- `~~property database` - (Optional) Integration with sales data APIs.

## Success Indicators

You've applied this skill well when:
- [ ] Appraisal justification is so clear that vendors accept the recommended price range.
- [ ] LIM/Title issues are identified and disclosed *before* the property goes to market.
- [ ] Investor buyers receive accurate yield models that match their bank's criteria.
- [ ] Buyers feel confident in their purchase due to the detailed Suburb/School info.
