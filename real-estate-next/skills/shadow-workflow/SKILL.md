# Shadow Workflow (The Contractor's Edge)

A strategic framework for independent real estate agents to maintain data sovereignty and operational efficiency through a private tech stack. This skill enables the "Shadow Brain" that operates parallel to corporate CRM systems, ensuring the agent owns their intelligence and personal brand.

**Important**: This skill is designed for agents who control their own private Google Workspace Admin account. It focuses on the separation of personal IP from corporate data while maintaining synchronization.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Receiving or auditing **Vault RE** webhook JSON payloads.
- Synthesizing forwarded email threads from a corporate account into a private admin account.
- Drafting client communications that need to be scrubbed of "Corporate Oversight" markers (Privacy Sanitizer).
- Mirroring CRM milestones (e.g., "Contract Signed via Secure Sign") into private Google Sheets or Tasks.
- Using **Gemini Pro** to analyze complex, multi-source client histories.
- Drafting "Shadow Marketing" content for **OpenClaw** that lives on personal profiles.

## Operational Context

| Workflow Element | Corporate Mode | Shadow Mode (Next) | Advantage |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **CRM** | Vault RE (Shared) | Private Sheet Mirror | Data Ownership |
| **Email** | RW Corporate | Private Gmail (Forwarded) | Gemini Pro Analysis |
| **Signing** | DocuSign (Audit trail) | Private Secure Sign Log | Milestone Control |
| **Marketing** | Agency Brand | **OpenClaw** Personal Brand | IP Preservation |

## Quick Reference

1. **Parse Webhook**: Analyze Vault RE JSON for property/contact updates.
2. **Synthesize Threads**: Use Gemini Pro to distill forwarded email context.
3. **Mirror Tasks**: Sync corporate milestones to your private task list.
4. **Sanitize Drafts**: Remove internal corporate jargon and tracking pixels.
5. **Brand Pulse**: Schedule personal posts via OpenClaw based on deal milestones.

## Detailed Guidance

### 1. Vault RE Webhook Parser

Process incoming JSON payloads:
- **`contact.added`**: Extract name, source, and notes. Auto-tag in private "Golden Database."
- **`property.updated`**: Detect status changes (e.g., "Appraisal" -> "Listing"). Trigger private marketing prep.
- **`user.update`**: Monitor for corporate configuration changes that might impact the shadow flow.

### 2. Email Forwarding Synthesis (Gemini Pro)

Independent agents often forward emails to a private admin account to leverage advanced AI:
- **Task**: Summarize long threads including attachments (multi-modal).
- **Cross-Reference**: Match email names against Vault RE contact IDs found in webhooks.
- **Action**: Draft replies in the private account, then copy-paste to the corporate sender.

### 3. The Privacy Sanitizer

Ensure outgoing communications don't reveal the "Shadow" setup:
- **Logic**: Strip hidden tracking pixels often added by corporate CRM mailers.
- **Tone**: Adjust language from "The Team at [Agency]" to "I" (Personal Brand focus).
- **Metadata**: Verify that PDF properties or document headers don't show "Private Admin" origins.

### 4. Task Mirroring

Maintain an invisible log of activity:
- **Trigger**: Webhook signals "Offer Received."
- **Action**: Update private Google Sheet "Deal Tracker" and create a high-priority Google Task.
- **Why**: Ensures if you lose access to the corporate CRM, your deal pipeline and client Intel remain with you.

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] **Webhook Log**: Record of parsed JSON events.
- [ ] **Situation Report**: Gemini Pro synthesis of forwarded emails + CRM data.
- [ ] **Private Task List**: Mirrored milestones from corporate systems.
- [ ] **Sanitized Draft**: Final communication ready for delivery.

## Common Mistakes (Anti-Patterns)

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Direct API write to Vault** | High audit risk; reveals shadow tool usage | Use the "Mirror" pattern: read from Vault, act in Private. |
| **Leaving corporate sig in private mail** | Looks unprofessional/confusing | Use separate, personal-brand signatures in the admin account. |
| **Storing PII in insecure Sheets** | Regulatory risk (Privacy Act) | Use encrypted fields or private Google Cloud storage. |
| **Ignoring Webhook latency** | Data becomes stale | Manually trigger `/shadow-sync` if real-time webhooks fail. |

## When to Escalate

Escalate to your private Tech Advisor or Solicitor when:
- Corporate IT signals a crackdown on email forwarding or third-party webhooks.
- A "Conflict of Interest" arises between personal brand IP and agency contracts.
- There is a breach of your private admin account credentials.

## Privacy Considerations

- **Data Sovereignty**: The agent is the owner of the "Shadow Brain."
- **Minimized Footprint**: Do not push private data back into the corporate CRM without explicit intent.
- **Regulatory**: Ensure your shadow workflow complies with the REA Act and Privacy Act 2020.

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Standard `contact.added` JSON payload | High | Auto-populate private log and suggest follow-up. |
| Fragmented email thread forwarded from 3 sources | Medium | Use Gemini Pro for "Deep Synthesis" and flag gaps. |
| Outgoing draft contains corporate tracking links | High | Flag for Sanitizer and propose clean version. |

## Tool Requirements

- `~~webhook listener` - Essential for real-time Vault RE integration.
- `~~cloud storage` - Private Google Workspace account.
- `~~social media` - OpenClaw for personal brand posts.

## Success Indicators

You've applied this skill well when:
- [ ] You have a complete, private mirror of your deal pipeline.
- [ ] You respond to client emails 50% faster thanks to Gemini Pro synthesis.
- [ ] Your personal brand (LinkedIn/IG) is active and deal-driven without corporate approval delays.
- [ ] Corporate management is unaware of your high-leverage private tech stack.
