# Specification: Real Estate Next Upgrade

## Overview
Evolution of the `real-estate` plugin into `real-estate-next`. This version is optimized for independent contractors maintaining a "Shadow Workflow" via private Google Workspace accounts, Vault RE webhooks, and OpenClaw branding.

## Changes
- Rename all `real-estate` references to `real-estate-next`.
- Add `shadow-workflow` skill for data sovereignty and private admin logic.
- Add `OPENCLAW.md` documentation for personal brand management.
- Implement `/webhook-audit`, `/shadow-sync`, `/private-brief`, and `/client-intel` commands.
- Update `CONNECTORS.md` and `.mcp.json` with OpenClaw and private admin hooks.

## Success Criteria
- Global rename complete.
- Shadow workflow logic handles Vault RE JSON and Gemini Pro synthesis.
- OpenClaw is established as a core social media connector.
