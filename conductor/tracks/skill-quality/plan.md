## Notes

### Execution Strategy
- Provide templates proactively as each health track begins implementation
- Quality review skills as they are created, not retroactively
- Ensure cross-references between related health skills
- Validate regulatory context for each domain

### Template Distribution
- Store templates in health/skills/.templates/ directory
- Reference in each health tracks spec.md
- Update templates based on track implementer feedback

### Quality Verification
For each completed health skill:
1. Run validation script for required sections
2. Verify regulatory context is appropriate for domain
3. Check privacy considerations are complete
4. Confirm escalation criteria are realistic
5. Validate cross-references to related health skills
