# Health Jurisdiction Baseline: Australia and New Zealand

## Default Position

Use Australia and New Zealand as the default jurisdictional lens for all `health` plugin workflows unless the user explicitly specifies another region.

## Australia (Baseline)

- AHPRA registration and practitioner regulation context
- NSQHS Standards for clinical safety and quality framing
- Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and APPs for patient information handling
- State and territory reporting obligations where applicable

## New Zealand (Baseline)

- Health and Disability Commissioner (HDC) Code context
- Health Information Privacy Code 2020 context
- Manatu Hauora and related reporting guidance context
- Te Whatu Ora operational pathway context where relevant

## Implementation Rules

- Always state assumed jurisdiction in generated outputs.
- For cross-border scenarios, require explicit user confirmation before applying non-AU/NZ rules.
- Escalate legal interpretation to qualified AU/NZ healthcare legal counsel.
