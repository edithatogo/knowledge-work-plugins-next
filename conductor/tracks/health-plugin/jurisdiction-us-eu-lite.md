# Health Jurisdiction Lite Variant: US and EU

Use this reference only when users explicitly request US or EU framing.

## United States (Lite)

- Provide high-level HIPAA/health-privacy framing only.
- Note state-level variation and organization-specific policy differences.
- Avoid detailed legal interpretation; recommend licensed US counsel for edge cases.

## European Union (Lite)

- Provide high-level GDPR and health-data sensitivity framing.
- Note member-state implementation differences.
- Avoid country-specific legal detail unless the user names a country.

## Scope Guardrail

This document defines a portability layer, not a full US/EU regulatory handbook.
